Polynomial Multiplication (Futurama)

Professor Farnsworth has been working on designing his new crazy invention, the Smell-O-Scope. This device lets mankind smell the different odors of the celestial bodies, over vast distances. Unfortunately these smells are sometimes mixed up while reaching earth. The Professor wants to model each smell as a function of various properties of the body, specifically as polynomials. He is also modelling the mixing of the smells as multiplying the two polynomials. If he can figure out the mixture formula he is sure that he can get back the original smells. Help the Professor work out the simulation so he can start smelling the universe.

Input Format
The first line of the input is n, the degree of the two following polynomials. The second line of the input consists of n+1 space separated integers a_0,...,a_n, where a_i is the coefficient of x^i. The third line consists of b_0,...,b_n, similar to above.

Constraints
n + 1 = 2^k, 2 <= k <=16.
0 <= a_i, b_i <= 9

Output Format
Output the coefficients of the product of the two polynomials, space separated in a single line, starting with the coefficient of x^0.
