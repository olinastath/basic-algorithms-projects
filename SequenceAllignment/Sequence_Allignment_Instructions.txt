Sequence Allignment (Futurama)

Professor Farnsworth has once again descended into a moronic battle of science and wits against his arch nemesis Professor Wernstrom, though this time it is a battle of honour on the basketball court. The Professor has decided to create a team of undefeatable mutants very unlike but not quite dissimilar to the ones he used to fight the Globetrotters to defend earths dignity. His diabolical scheme is to use the DNA of the best NBA players to manufacture the perfect team. But he wants to use players who have a varied expertise to make sure that each mutant is the best possible one for the team composition. Help the Professor so that he is best able to analyze the sequence of any two players.

Input Format
The input consists of two lines, where each sequence a and b are the DNA sequence of the players.

Constraints
1 <= |a|, |b| <= 3100

Output Format
First output the optimal score of aligning the two sequences. Assume that scoring matrix adds  to the score for a match and  for a mismatch. Then output an optimal alignment of the two sequences.
